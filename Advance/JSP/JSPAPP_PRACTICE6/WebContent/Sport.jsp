<h2>The Workout That Saves Lindsey Vonn From Wipeouts </h2>

NewsOnline:<%=new java.util.Date() %>Lindsey Vonn is the most decorated World Cup ski racer in United States history, but Olympic glory has been more elusive. Her three Winter Games, going back to 2002, have yielded just one gold medal and one bronze, both in Vancouver in 2010; she missed the Sochi Games in 2014 because of injury. Now 33, following more years of wear and tear that included multiple ruptured knee ligaments, a fractured right humerus, a concussion and an acute facet spinal-joint dysfunction, Vonn will still be among the favorites in Pyeongchang, where she will race in at least the downhill, super-G and Alpine combined events. Just last month, she won her 79th World Cup race, becoming the oldest woman to win in downhill.
